CrackWare is the next-generation password and malware framework, with modules that spread from low-level firmware injection to rapid password cracking for RemoteCodeExecution and anti forensic tools not to get caught by blue teams. CrackWare was inspired by MetaSploit Framework, Flipper Zero and John the Ripper

The tools are divided to 6 categories: Exploitation, Cracking, Post-Exploit, Wireless

To initialize CrackWare: 
```
./CrackWare.sh
```
To start and stop CrackWare labs
```
crackware-labs.initialize
crackware-labs stop
```

# CrackWare Firmware
CrackWare Firmware are firmware attack tools. Category: Exploit, Post-Exploit
# CrackWare Tables
CrackWare Tables are rainbow tables that consist of both easy and complex reduction capabilities. Category: Cracking
# CrackWare BankHack
CrackWare BankHack tests vulnerabilities in banks and are capable of erasing money footprints and draining.Category: Exploit, Post-Exploit, Cracking
# CrackWare Games
CrackWare Games try to perform game server exploitation and post-exploitation: Category: Exploit, Post-Exploit, Cracking
# CrackWare Bluetooth
CrackWare Bluetooth perform BlueTooth attacks. Category: Wireless, Cracking
# CrackWare Evil-Twin
CrackWare Evil Twin are tools that emulate routers and perform an Evil Twin Attack. Category: Wireless, Cracking
# CrackWare Hardware-and-Firmware
CrackWare Hardware-and-Firmware are emulation tools that emulate specific hardware and firmware on the KVM(Kernel-Virtual-Machine) Linux module. Category: None
# CrackWare Radio
CrackWare Radio perform SDR and RFID hacking. Category: Wireless, Exploit
# CrackWare Remote-Code-Execution
CrackWare Remote-Code-Execution executes rce attacks. Category: Post-Exploit
# CrackWare Stegonagraphy
CrackWare Steganography perform stego encryption either offensively or anti-forensics. Category: Cracking
# CrackWare BlueBots
CrackWare BlueBots are for red teamers. BlueBots contain a wordlist and a code. They attack a target blue teamer or other defensive members and perform a dictionary attack on a defensive. The defensive bot is under BlueBot's control and uses the defenders to further compromise the defenders or to perform an interior penetration test from within. Category: Exploit, Post-Exploit, Cracking
# CrackWare Infared
CrackWare Infared tools perform infared emulation to emulate infared waves that confuse MCU chips. Category: Wireless
# CrackWare NewbieExploit
CrackWare NewbieExploit attacks new members of an enterpruse or organisation who are mostly confused in an environment. Uses the BlueBot method but stays more secret as privelege escalation works only on senior members.
