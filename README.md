CrackWare is the next-generation password and malware framework, with modules that spread from low-level firmware injection to rapid password cracking for RemoteCodeExecution and anti forensic tools not to get caught by blue teams. CrackWare was inspired by tools like John the Ripper and Hashcat

The tools are divided to 4 categories: Exploitation, Cracking, Post-Exploit, Wireless

CrackWare has 

# CrackWare Firmware
CrackWare Firmware are firmware attack tools. Category: Exploit, Post-Exploit
# CrackWare Tables
CrackWare Tables are rainbow tables that consist of both easy and complex reduction capabilities. Category: Cracking
# CrackWare BankHack
CrackWare BankHack tests vulnerabilities in banks and are capable of erasing money footprints and draining.Category: Exploit, Post-Exploit, Cracking
# CrackWare Games
CrackWare Games try to perform game server exploitation and post-exploitation: Category: Exploit, Post-Exploit, Cracking
# CrackWare Bluetooth
CrackWare Bluetooth perform BlueTooth attacks. Category: Wireless, Cracking
# CrackWare Evil-Twin
CrackWare Evil Twin are tools that emulate routers and perform an Evil Twin Attack. Category: Wireless, Cracking
# CrackWare Radio
CrackWare Radio perform SDR and RFID hacking. Category: Wireless, Exploit
# CrackWare Remote-Code-Execution
CrackWare Remote-Code-Execution executes rce attacks. Category: Post-Exploit
# CrackWare Stegonagraphy
CrackWare Steganography perform stego encryption either offensively or anti-forensics. Category: Cracking
# CrackWare BlueBots
CrackWare BlueBots are for red teamers. BlueBots contain a wordlist and a code. They attack a target blue teamer or other defensive members and perform a dictionary attack on a defensive. The defensive bot is under BlueBot's control and uses the defenders to further compromise the defenders or to perform an interior penetration test from within. Category: Exploit, Post-Exploit, Cracking
# CrackWare Infared
CrackWare Infared tools perform infared emulation to emulate infared waves that confuse MCU chips. Category: Wireless
# CrackWare NewbieExploit
CrackWare NewbieExploit attacks new members of an enterpruse or organisation who are mostly confused in an environment. Uses the BlueBot method but stays more secret as privelege escalation works only on senior members. Category: Exploit, Post-Exploit, Cracking
# CrackWare Threat-Model
CrackWare Threat-Model are threat modeling tools. Category: Exploit
# CrackWare Lateral 
CrackWare Lateral use an infected computer to continue infect computers in a network. Category: Post-Exploit, Wireless
# CrackWare DDoS 
CrackWare DDoS is a distributed denial of service toolkit. Category: Exploit, Wireless
# CrackWare Binary
CrackWare Binary are binary exploitation and attack tools. Category: Exploit
# CrackWare PtH
CrackWare PtH use pass the hash methods that don't use decryption on hashes to attack. Category: Cracking
# CrackWare MData 
CrackWare VoIP attacks mobile networks, like IDD, voip, SMS, MMS and cellular data. Category: Wireless, Cracking
# CrackWare Auditor
CrackWare Auditor performs code auditing and generates weakness reports to see if the audited code matches a CVE in order to exploit a potential weakness. Category: Exploit
# CrackWare Loopback
CrackWare Loopback use feeded hashes and use the cracked hashes to combine them into passwords. Category: Cracking
# CrackWare Fingerprint
CrackWare Fingerprint take known passwords and modify parts of the passwords. Category: Cracking
# CrackWare Biometrics
CrackWare Biometrics attack biometrics on IoT systems and scan a fingerprint to beam back into a file. Category: Cracking, Exploit
# CrackWare Hybrid-Crack
CrackWare Hybrid-Crack use different password cracking methods and hybridises. Category: Cracking
# CrackWare Purple-rain
CrackWare Purple-rain executes purple rain attacks. Category: Cracking
# CrackWare Keylogger
CrackWare Keylogger is a keylogger that is antivirus-undetectable and is a worm. Category: Exploit, Post-Exploit
# CrackWare Samples
CrackWare Samples are a hexed collection of malware and a malware-capturing tool for red teamers. Category: Exploit, Wireless
# CrackWare OSINT
CrackWare OSINT execute OSINT analysis for taking data(may contain APIs). Category: Exploit, Cracking
# CrackWare Injector
CrackWare Injector is a code injector that injects binaries or code into a targeted machine. Category: Cracking, Exploit 
# CrackWare API
CrackWare API attacks APIs in a network or local. Category: Wireless, Exploit, Post-Exploit
# CrackWare PurpleBot
CrackWare PurpleBot strike purple teams using similar concepts to BlueBots. Category: Exploit, Wireless 
# CrackWare YellowBot
CrackWare YellowBot attacks yellow teams like PurpleBots and BlueBots.
# CrackWare AI
# CrackWare Wireless-Radio
CrackWare Wireless-Radio use pre-attacked devices on wireless assaults to attack radios. Category: Wireless, Post-Exploit
