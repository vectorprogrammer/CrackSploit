CrackWare is the next-generation password and malware framework, with modules that spread from low-level firmware injection to rapid password cracking for RemoteCodeExecution and anti forensic tools not to get caught by blue teams

The tools are divided to 6 categories: Mobile, Exploitation, Cracking, Post-Exploit, Wireless, Malware

*Note* CrackWare is not designed for  threat modeling, vulnerability assessment or security auditing but the exploitation modules may help
